# titled.tuesday

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The `titled.tuesday` R package pulls all games played by titled players from the [Chess.com API](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api). This includes ***Titled Tuesday standings***, all game ***PGNs***, ***Results***, ***Ratings***, and even ***Accuracies***.

If you just want the data, it is stored in the [data-raw folder](https://github.com/IgorRigolon/titled.tuesday/tree/main/data-raw).

## Installation

You can install the development version of `titled.tuesday` from GitHub with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("IgorRigolon/titled.tuesday")
```

## Usage

To download all Titled Tuesday standings, run

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(titled.tuesday)

dat <- tt_results()
```

To download all Titled Tuesday games since 2023, run

```{r example2, eval = FALSE}
dat <- tt_games(years = c(2023, 2024))
```

To download all games ever played by titled players on Chess.com, simply use the `tt_only` option (very heavy)

```{r example3, eval = FALSE}
dat <- tt_games(tt_only = FALSE, years = "all")
```

If you need the full PGNs with all moves from each game, use the `include_pgn` option. Note that this makes the final product significantly heavier.

```{r example4, eval = FALSE}
dat <- tt_games(years = 2024, include_pgn = TRUE)
```

## How it works

### Results

First, the `get_tournaments` function crawls through all pages (the number of pages will have to be updated manually, there are currently 18) of the [Chess.com TT Tournaments page](https://www.chess.com/tournament/live/titled-tuesdays) and get the tournament code for each TT, which makes up their URL.

Then, the `get_download_url` function calls the API to obtain the number of rounds in each TT, and returns a final URL, which is used as an API call by `tt_results`.

### Games

The Chess.com Tournaments API only sends results for the final round of each Titled Tuesday. To get all games, I obtain the list of all titled usernames with `get_titled_players`, and then ask the API for all their games using `get_games`. The `tt_games` function simply loops over all titled players and stacks up their games.
